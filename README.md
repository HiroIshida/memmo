## Memmory of motion
Source code in `regression.py` implements memmo of Lembono et al. of RA-L(2020) `Lembono, Teguh Santoso, et al. "Memory of motion for warm-starting trajectory optimization." IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters 5.2 (2020): 2594-2601.`

The source code is primary based on there relevant implementation found in https://github.com/teguhSL/memmo_for_trajopt_codes (more specifically https://github.com/teguhSL/memmo_for_trajopt_codes/blob/master/notebooks/regression.py) Modification on made only on structure level: using dataclass and abstract class to unify the interface and so on, and the detail implementation including hyper-parameter is left c:
intact.
